# -Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
 Built with Python, OpenCV, and CNN-based models, it showcases how computer vision can be applied to real-world safety solutions.
Video-based Face Mask Detection

This project demonstrates a Face Mask Detection system using OpenCV, Python, and Deep Learning models. It processes video streams (webcam or pre-recorded) to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time.

📌 Features

Detect faces from video frames using OpenCV.

Classify each face as Mask 😷 or No Mask 🙅.

Works with both live webcam feed and video files.

Easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and learning.

📂 Project Files

Video Based Facemask Detection Model Creation.ipynb

Notebook for creating and training the mask detection model.

Video based FaceMask Detection Open CV Usage.ipynb

Notebook for applying the trained model on video streams using OpenCV.
